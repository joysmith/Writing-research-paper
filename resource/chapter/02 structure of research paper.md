### 1. Abstract<a id='1'></a>

an abstract is a summary of your research article limited of 250 to 300 words comprises of IMRDC structure

examples:

- [abstract](https://github.com/joysmith/Writing-research-paper/blob/main/resource/assets/paper/01%20abstract/01%20%20Data%20Dissemination%20Protocol%20for%20Mobile%20Sink%20in%20Wireless%20Sensor.pdf)
- [abstract](https://github.com/joysmith/Writing-research-paper/blob/main/resource/assets/paper/01%20abstract/02%20.pdf)
- [abstract](https://github.com/joysmith/Writing-research-paper/blob/main/resource/assets/paper/01%20abstract/03%20MSGR_A_Mode-Switched_Grid-based_Sustainable_Routin.pdf)

<br>

### 2. Introduction<a id='2'></a>

In introduction we cover following topics-

1. Background: historical data, definitions, key terms
2. Existing evidence: literature survey with citation
3. Research gap: what has not been solved or accomplished
4. Objective: what we/you are planning to accomplish/do
5. Scope: constraint of research or boundary of research

<br>

### 3. Material and methods<a id='3'></a>

1. List of materials: used in experiment
2. Step by step procedure of my method; for CS is algorithm
3. Tools and instrument used for data analysis

Ensure reliability of experiments, the experiment should be transparent

<br>

### 4. Results and discussion<a id='4'></a>

1. Data: visual, graphic etc
2. Result: explanation of data
3. Discussion: attaching meaning to result in present research context or scenario

<br>

### 5. Conclusion<a id='5'></a>

1. Objective: achievements or findings we approached
2. Review key findings
3. Implications of applications
4. Recommendations for future

example

- [conclusion]()
- [conclusion]()
- [conclusion]()

<br>

### 6. Reference<a id='6'></a>

Give credits to the source in a list following a specific citation style

example

- [Reference](https://github.com/joysmith/Writing-research-paper/blob/main/resource/assets/paper/06%20reference/01%20%20Data%20Dissemination%20Protocol%20for%20Mobile%20Sink%20in%20Wireless%20Sensor.pdf)
- [Reference](https://github.com/joysmith/Writing-research-paper/blob/main/resource/assets/paper/06%20reference/02%20.pdf)
- [Reference](https://github.com/joysmith/Writing-research-paper/blob/main/resource/assets/paper/06%20reference/03%20MSGR_A_Mode-Switched_Grid-based_Sustainable_Routin.pdf)

<br>

### 7. Finding title of your paper<a id='7'></a>

at last we do 10-20 words that give some meaning

<br>

### 8. Finding keywords<a id='8'></a>

after/below abstract we put keywords

### 9. How to start writing paper "Process: The order :order"

1. Material and Methods
2. Introduction part(method that you used, the definition, research gap, literature survey)
3. Results and discussion
4. Conclusion
5. Reference: meanwhile writing above step fill the citation in different section also updating reference section
6. Abstract
7. Title: give title to paper
