1. Step 1: How to choose a research topic
2. Step 2: Do your own research
3. Step 3: Writing a research paper
4. Step 4: Structure of a research paper

### Step 1: How to choose a research topic

- Approach a professor
- Identify current research area on which professors are working on (across the world)
- Narrow down a broad topic by reading review papers and research papers

### Step 2: Do your own research

1. Experimental research
2. Theoretical research

- conclusion End of it you should arrive at a result which is novel and it contributes to the research field and makes some impact

### Step 3: Writing a research paper

- A research paper is an account of an investigation conducted by one or more researchers sharing their findings with the research community using a conventional report structure

### Step 4: Structure of a research paper

- IMRDC structure of a research paper

  - Introduction
  - Materials and method
  - Results and discussion
  - Conclusion

#### Note-

- In introduction we generally mention the motivation background research problem that we are working on
- In the conclusion we write the finding from that research problem then we talk what we have achieved and contributed to the research field
- For every method there is a result and for every result there is a method how we arrived on it
